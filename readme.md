This is a Meteor.js project; it is a simple chat application between
predetermined users. You can use these credentials to try out:
user1@test.com ... user8@test.com --password is test123 for all.
You need to login first, the decide who you want to chat with.
The other user needs to login as well and decides he/she needs to chat with you.
You need two instances of browsers to login as separate users. You need to use either:
two different browsers (the same user is remembered on the same brwoser), OR
just run another instance of the same browser in incognito mode.
